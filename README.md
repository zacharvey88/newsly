# Newsly - A Modern News Platform

Welcome to Newsly, a comprehensive news platform built using React with Vite, communicating with a Node.js backend hosted on Render. This project is part of my software development bootcamp with Northcoders and builds on the backend which I previously built. You can view that repository [here](https://github.com/zacharvey88/nc-news).
